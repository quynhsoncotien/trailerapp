You are probably feeling the baby’s movements more regularly now, but it depends on the position of the baby and the placenta. Baby is still only 1% body fat but will start to add a type of fat known as brown fat that is the same fat you are gaining during pregnancy. Brown fat converts quickly into energy. It helps keep baby insulated and a ready supply of food in between mama’s meals. The arms and legs continue to grow, and full formed eyebrows are present which means your baby can frown or furrow them especially when you eat those nasty foods like garlic and asparagus. Do not stop eating a variety of vegetables because he or she will have to get used to them one of these days – take note, food aversions start now. Ever wonder if picky eaters are that way because of what they were fed by mama? Of course, mothers are blamed for everything, and it starts long before entry into the new world. Here’s an idea, have your partner read to Junior while you are sleeping – that way he or she can get used to their voice, too. Finally, some needed relief."
