  "content": "This little kidney bean is doing acrobatic movements – even looks like a pale kidney bean, too. Arms and hands develop sooner than legs, but baby's hands are developing webbed fingers. Their early lung tubes are branching out into the chest cavity, and the funny little tail is gone. Primitive neural pathways are growing and expanding to prepare for more dramatic movements. Ear parts are starting to form inside and out. The first genitals are not fully developed, but the ovaries will contain all the eggs that a little girl will have for a lifetime – and that’s hundreds of thousands more than she needs. Either way, your baby – is continually moving and shifting, though you still can't feel it. The head is massive in proportion to the rest of the baby's body. By the end of the 8th week, your baby is about 1 inch long and weighs about 1/30 of an ounce. \r\n\r\nAlthough baby is moving, you won’t notice anything for a while.  It takes time for baby to grow big enough for you to feel it!  You may notice that baby moves more when there is music playing, or when you’re talking or singing, or after you eat something sweet or cold. Sometimes you might notice a very rhythmic movement – it might be hiccups! These aren’t dangerous for the baby."}
