It is still too early to feel these movements unless this is your second baby. Eyebrows and a hairline are forming, and as the hair gets longer, it can look like its sticking straight up rather than lying flat – just like you see when swimming. The placenta is enlarging and preparing for the increased food and energy demands of this active fetus. So, what happens when the fetal blood from the umbilical cord hits the placenta? For one, mom’s blood gets to the uterus via her uterine artery filled with oxygen, glucose, and other nutrients. There, two systems, although they remain separated, meet and exchange contents – baby gives mother carbon dioxide and other waste products for her to get rid of via her lungs, kidneys, and liver. And mama provides everything baby needs to grow bigger and bigger. It’s a complicated system. We’ll talk about the fetal lung situation in a minute – because it’s fascinating to learn how blood partially bypasses the fluid-filled lungs that are not ready to do their jobs yet. In fact, immature lungs cause most of the complications associated with premature births. Best to keep Junior inside as long as possible."
