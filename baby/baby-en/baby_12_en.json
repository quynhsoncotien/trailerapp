  "content": "The baby learns to respond to external sounds and lights at this stage of pregnancy. When you tap on your abdomen with a finger, your little lime-sized baby will move. Thus, reflexes are born.\r\n\r\nThe intestines are almost entirely in the abdominal cavity. The kidneys produce urine that travels to the babyâ€™s bladder. Your little humanoid now has eyes front and center. The arms and legs look twig-like, but have fingers and toes. Those twigs will be pudgy and cute soon enough when they gain fat in the last weeks of pregnancy. Bone marrow begins the production of white blood cells, and even hormones are released from the pituitary in the brain."
