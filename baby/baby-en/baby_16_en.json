Week 15-18 are good weeks to have another ultrasound and ultrasounds are excellent tools for doctors to look for signs of healthy organs, both in size, and shape. Ever heard the term hamburger sign or turtle sign? Well, if the doctor sees a turtle between the baby’s legs, you’re having a boy! A hamburger means a girl, but sometimes the umbilical cord or legs get in the way, and you can’t tell exactly. Doctors also look for a banana sign and a lemon sign to evaluate the brain structures, but that is rarely found except in rare birth defects. Bones are measured such as the femur – upper leg bone, and skull size is beneficial to determine the due date or EDC if an ultrasound has not been done yet. The bones look greyish-white on ultrasounds at this point and signify early hardening or ossification. No worries though, the bone growth plates do not fuse until well into early adolescence, and teenage years once full height is obtained. Same for the skull bones – actually, there are multiple ones in the womb. They are separated by spaces and are soft enough to result in the classic cone-head after the birthing process. Baby is a bit less than a half of a foot and over 2 ounces now, getting ready for a growth spurt that lasts for the duration of pregnancy."
