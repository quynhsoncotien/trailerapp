Keep hydrated, and rest more so you can make it to your due date. All the fat cells are getting bigger. There will be no more fat cells produced, but they will swell. As an adult, most people will appreciate that fact. How did that baby get a hold of their toes? The fetal position makes that difficult, but other positions not so much. Babies who are breech are often in a ‘U’ shape with their butts on the cervix and their legs up by their faces. Flexible little beings, they are, but their bones are still getting harder and stronger. And, they are contortionists because many breech babies have completely flipped. Some women swear by doing summersaults in a pool to encourage that to happen. If the baby is stubborn, your doctor may do a ‘version’ by manipulating the baby through the abdominal walls. It’s not super simple to do, but worth a try."
