She has to endure so much for me. Thanks for dessert! Someday, your baby will make you very proud – with the first word being mama, dada, or mama dada. Gestational diabetes can occur in some mothers even without a family history of diabetes, but no worries, it’s pretty easy to get under control with nutritional changes. No more sweets for mom. Time for testicle descent now. If you are having a boy, they are on their way out. Their hands tend to wander down there to check out all the action. Baby is about 2 pounds now, and you can feel him or her when you get up out a chair too fast. Grow, develop, mature, that’s all for now."
