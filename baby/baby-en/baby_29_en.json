Well, it turns out that you can either be Rh-negative or -positive. Most people carry the Rh protein on their blood cells. When an Rh-negative mother is pregnant, the baby’s red blood cells can cross the placenta and enter Mother’s bloodstream. If Baby is Rh positive, the mother doesn’t recognize that protein and makes attack antibodies to kill those cells. To prevent this attack on her baby, RhoGam is administered at 28 weeks to coat those positive proteins so that Mother doesn’t make antibodies. It’s a little more complicated, but thanks to an Austrian immunologist who won the Nobel Peace Prize and for scientists later on, babies do not die from ‘fetal hydrops’ which is when the baby is severely anemic and has heart failure. If you haven’t heard of RhoGam, it’s because you are Rh positive. A RhoGam shot is also given postpartum. So, the baby keeps growing, and life is getting very exciting for the expectant parents."
