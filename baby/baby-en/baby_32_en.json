It’s not entirely understood, but the genetic code starts at conception and predisposes some babies to be plumper than others and may have nothing do with how much the mother eats. There are short, tall, heavy, and thin people who are just naturally that way as a result of DNA. Some mothers swear that their bigger child made them eat more compared to their smaller child. Makes sense, really. Best to keep the meals small and frequent to avoid the gut-wrenching burning from heartburn. And, don’t forget twice daily kick counts while resting on your left side. The left side position keeps all the pressure off the inferior vena cava – the what? It's the big vein that returns blood to your heart. You’ll get lightheaded if there’s too much pressure."
