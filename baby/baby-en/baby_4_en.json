{"week":4,"reading_time":120000,"content":"Technically, your microscopic embryo is called an embryo once the blastocyst implants into the wall of the uterus and creates the placenta and amniotic sac. Your baby is now about as big as half of a kiwi seed. Cells separate into three types to form different organs, and tissues of the body. The placenta is a plate-like structure that ends up looking like a thickened pancake that lays adjacent to the uterine lining. Here the blood vessels of the placenta intermingle with your blood vessels.  Oxygen and nutrients are transferred across the membranes of the vessels and are then taken to the embryo via the umbilical vein within the cord. The placenta makes the fluid for the amniotic sac until the kidneys take over later. This embryonic period lasts until the 9th week of pregnancy when your little person becomes a fetus. All the organs are forming, moving to the right general location, and some even begin to work (like the heart!). Progesterone, estrogen, and hCG are rapidly increasing. The hCG count should double every 2 days to indicate a normal pregnancy. \r\n\r\nThe embryo is very vulnerable to anything that you eat, drink, or are exposed to. So, unless recommended by your practitioner, you should avoid anything other than food, water and prenatal vitamins. The first visit is the best time to discuss any concerns. \r\n\r\nIf you have been exposed to any toxins or drugs at this very vulnerable time of the baby\u2019s formation, you can expect one of two things: either there will be such an \u201cinsult\u201d that the baby will not continue to form (creating a very early miscarriage), or there will be no effect at all. The obstetrical community calls this the \u201call or none effect\u201d. Unfortunately, your practitioner may not be able to find enough information on the specific effects of a particular teratogen (something that can damage the developing embryo), and only time will tell."}
