Through a series of wavelike motions, the zygote goes up and down as it travels and grows in preparation for burrowing into the soft, nutrient dense uterus. It then implants and becomes a blastocyst which is about 200 cells and only 0.1-0.2 mm in size. The zygote may prematurely implant in an unusual place such as the fallopian tube, but it’s not common unless the tube has been damaged. The blastocyst ultimately becomes an embryo with a placenta and amniotic sac, which will be the baby’s home for the rest of the pregnancy. The beginning of the placenta comes from the blastocyst, known as the trophoblast. The placenta is the source of a blood supply for the fetus that is delivered via the umbilical cord. The umbilical cord isn’t quite developed yet, but when it is, it sends wastes back to the mother’s blood for disposal while the nutrients come from the mother’s blood and are transferred via the placenta to the baby via the umbilical cord. The entire process of implantation requires enzymes and growth factors such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which can be detected in a pregnancy test that can be detected in about another week – first in your blood, then in your urine. hCG is responsible for the blastocyst and trophoblast penetration into the uterine wall."}
