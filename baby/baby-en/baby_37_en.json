He or she is about 6 pounds give or take, but sometimes it’s not always easy to tell by measuring the ‘fundal height’ that should be about 37 centimeters. If you measure bigger or smaller, your doctor may do an ultrasound to check out the size. They will check the head size, the abdominal circumference and the length of the thigh bone and then calculate the weight based on a set of tables. The machine calculates it with computer software. The result can be off by almost a half-pound or more, but it gives you an idea. The amniotic fluid will also be measured. If it’s too low, you will probably have a non-stress test to make sure baby is fine. Then, you will have your cervix checked to see if your water broke and if you are dilated. Low fluid is a reason for an induction – or the artificial cause of contractions and labor. It’s a pretty common occurrence, and there is nothing to worry about. Low fluid can be a concern because the umbilical cord can get compressed without any protection. It’s best to have a baby now to avoid any problems in the future."
