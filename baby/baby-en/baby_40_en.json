So, keep a bag packed and in the car in case your water breaks at the mall. I’m sure that’s the last place you would be, but just in case. Baby seems like a giant sac of potatoes and you can hardly walk without a grimace. Some practitioners will start non-stress tests at 40 weeks, some wait until 41. If you haven’t had an ultrasound to check fetal size and fluid level, you probably will have one at this point. Your doctor feels your pain and wants any reason to take you out of your misery. More growing, more staring at the boring inside of the uterus, but baby is doing just fine."
