The liver begins making more red blood cells – a job once done by the yolk sac. If you could scuba-dive around the amniotic cavity, you could spot tiny nails and distinct fingers and toes, fuzzy-stuff on the skin that will eventually be lanugo hair. The baby can bend his or her limbs and makes weird movements. Eyelids remain shut, but the eye color is forming. The head is still like a potato head and about half the size of the whole body. A doppler stethoscope can be used to hear the heartbeat at 10 weeks. Still too early to see any genitals yet. The spinal bone is forming, and that reptilian tail is gone – and part of the neck is visible. Only a quarter of an ounce and the size of an egg, this super baby will double in size in a few weeks."}
