A vaginal culture will be done by your practitioner to check for Group B Beta Streptococcus (GBS), a bacterium that is entirely harmless to you but can harm your baby. If you test positive, you will be given antibiotics when you go into labor. No big deal. Sometimes, you will actually see the baby move by the bulging of part of your abdomen wall. Try playing this game with your little one, by poking different areas of your belly to see if you can get a reaction. Every organ is humming away and getting fine-tuned for the big debut. Grab a cold drink, put your feet up and dream of your future together. It’s going to be so much fun."
