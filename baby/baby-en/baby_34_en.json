The exact cause or trigger for labor is not entirely understood. One interesting study showed that the baby itself may decide when to be born by releasing a protein from the surfactant in his or her lungs that interacts with maternal immune cells to create an inflammatory response in the uterus. Inflammation is a well-known factor in premature births, though the source is not from the fetal lungs, more likely an infection or inflammation from another source - like vaginitis. Other views are that the fetal adrenal glands release a hormone that triggers a maternal response."
