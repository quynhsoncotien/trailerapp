If baby isn’t jumbo size, he or she will likely come out the good old-fashioned way. If not, cesarean sections are a great option, too. Some women even prefer this over a vaginal birth, but should remember that a cesarean section is major surgery, and has significant risks now and in the future. No one really knows if a baby will fit through the birth canal, but some pelvises are narrower than others and it has nothing to do with the mother’s size externally. Small women can do just as well as larger women. Congratulations, motherhood is imminent. You swear that you will never do this again – but as every woman knows, there’s a mysterious hormone of amnesia that circulates and erases all the pain once you take your first glance at your bundle of joy."
