  "content": "Baby’s nutrition is coming from the placenta – via mama. Swallowing helps the digestive tract to mature. The contents of the intestines are called meconium – black-greenish and sticky like molasses. It is composed of cells from the amniotic sac, lanugo, vernix, mucus, amniotic fluid, and water. Baby may have its first bowel movement in the womb, but it usually occurs much later. No need to worry since the stool is sterile in the uterus; however, the passage of meconium before birth can signify a period of stress while baby is inside. If you are having a baby girl, her vagina is fully formed at this point. The heartbeat is normally 120-160 beats per minute and can be heard with a stethoscope. It sounds like galloping horses – a stampede. With all 10 fingers and toes completely developed, the baby can suck his or her thumb – maybe even their whole fist for some kids. They have wake-sleep cycles and may prefer sleeping in one favorite position. Baby’s movements should remain steady now – 6-10 an hour when awake. Did you know that there are one vein and two arteries in the umbilical cord? Cords are twisted into a helix and can have fake knots or actual knots. Short and long cords have no significance and cords around the neck are common with very active babies and long cords. Cords are made of soft, spongy jelly that protects the blood vessels from pressure in the uterus."
