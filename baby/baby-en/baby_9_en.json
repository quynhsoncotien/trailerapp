Ears are forming, and the eyelids are fused shut. There are tiny fingers and toes, but they look swollen. The intestines are being pulled into the body cavity from the umbilical cord. The urinary system separates from the genital system, but the actual genitals are indistinguishable as boy or girl. The heart is completely divided into 4 chambers with early-forming valves. Their eyes are still on the side of the head, but the features are surprisingly human at this point. The end of the embryo period has been replaced with the fetal period. The liver and pancreas get more significant and more productive. Early bones start to ossify – hardening from cartilage to bone-like."}
