Watch for sudden hand, face, and feet swelling – it could be a sign of pre-eclampsia that can affect moms without warning. See your practitioner or go to the labor and delivery unit if that occurs especially if you have a new onset headache. It’s a serious disease that causes your blood pressure to go up without explanation, but it’s totally manageable with the delivery of your baby. Keep track of baby’s activities, movement should be same as always. Nothing more you can do except wait and wait. Soon, you will wonder where all your time goes."
