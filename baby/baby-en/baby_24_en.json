So, what about that fetal circulation? Remember, the baby gets oxygen and nutrients from mother via the umbilical cord, so there is no reason for all the blood to go to the lungs while the baby is still cooking. There is a neat little detour that the blood makes after it returns to the heart – it is called the ductus arteriosis – a small vessel that reroutes most of the blood going to the lungs, and sends it out the aorta to the rest of the body where it’s needed. An even cooler thing happens at birth – when we don’t want that detour – the ductus closes off automatically with the first couple of breaths. This allows the lungs to receive all the blood to give it oxygen and release the carbon dioxide before it is sent to the rest of the body. In preemies – premature babies – that closure doesn’t always happen automatically – so it’s a big issue. Keep Junior inside for as long as possible – you are best babysitter there is at this point. Baby weighs over one pound now."
