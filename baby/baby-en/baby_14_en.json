Thumb sucking can occur now as can grasping and stretching. The arms and legs are growing more proportionally, and stretching activities are possible – overall, the baby is quite flexible. The liver is kicking out bile, those nasty digestive juices, even though there is little to digest except amniotic fluid. Let’s talk about that fetal circulation that is opposite from what the blood flow will be doing once the tyke is out of the oven. Usually, oxygenated blood flows from the lungs to the rest of the body via the arterial system. And, blood lacking oxygen and nutrients returns to the heart via veins. In the case of the baby, who cannot breathe oxygen yet, the umbilical artery has the least amount of oxygen and food as it is on its way to the placenta to collect its food and oxygen from mama. More on that later."
