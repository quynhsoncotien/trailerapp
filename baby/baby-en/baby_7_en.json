This blueberry embryo of yours has transparent skin and black spots for eyes. A pointed tip of a nose can barely be seen at this point. You can see brain tissue because the skull is not solid. The baby’s face is slumped over the protruding purplish heart as 100,000 new nerve cells grow each minute. This allows their body to move in jerky spurts. You are a long way away from feeling any movement, but it’s fun to see them on ultrasound. If this is your first pregnancy, you may not feel the movements until 20 weeks. The liver is making red blood cells, and the pancreas starts to produce insulin. \r\n\r\nThere's a fantastic little factory inside you, and it’s no wonder you are so tired.\r\n\r\nYour practitioner doesn’t focus on the baby’s development during the first 13 weeks, or “trimester”, because it would mean frequent ultrasounds to measure the growth, and it is best to limit tests that are not necessary.  Your practitioner will focus on Mama – your weight, blood pressure, and general well-being. \r\n\r\nYou will have a chance to get a good look at your baby during the second trimester ultrasound, usually done between weeks 18 and 22.  They will be able to measure its head, belly, and thigh for a good estimation of size and age; they’ll also check different organs – heart, stomach, kidneys – and structures – face, limbs, spine and belly wall – to be sure everything is developing as it should.  They’ll also look at the placenta, making sure it’s in the right spot.  After that, since everything should be formed, they will watch baby’s growth by measuring your abdomen."}
