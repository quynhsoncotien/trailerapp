Sorry, but most babies do not drop this early although they may be head down. Babyâ€™s brain is getting wrinkles that account for all the grooves seen in an adult brain. Skin is filling out with fat underneath. The eyes and ears are getting ready to work outside of there. The grasping reflex occurs now where the baby can grab their own finger and will grab yours and make your heart weak. Doctors report instruments being grabbed by the baby as it exits the birth canal or the abdomen during a cesarean. So, make sure your camera or phone is charged up. Some people opt for a 3D/4D ultrasound to get a real portrait view of their baby where the features can be seen so clearly, and facial expressions will be a delight."
