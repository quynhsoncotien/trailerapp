Space is at a premium, and they will roll around and shift like crazy to find their place. Keep those small frequent meals going even if you only have one inside, because they are hungry little parasites that need food to grow. At 28 weeks, the hiccupping and breathing motions are becoming more frequent, although some do not hiccup much at all. This is all training for coming into the atmosphere. The baby cannot breathe on his or her own but is making more surfactant – or the enzyme needed to keep the air sacs (alveoli) open for business. Brain activity is becoming more advanced, and eyelashes are peaking out. You are now officially in your last trimester."
