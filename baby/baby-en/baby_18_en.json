This sheath grows into adolescence. Folate keeps the nerves healthy among other things. So, don't stop them. If you are having a baby girl, the uterus and fallopian tubes are ready and in position. Your little tomato or sweet potato is just under a half a pound. Ears are erect and in their final spot with bones hardening inside – able to hear and recognize mama’s voice. Tiny teeth are coming into the gums, but of course not protruding yet. Even taste buds are starting to work – so watch the garlic, or you might have a steaming mad little fetus jumping around in rebellion. Baby sleeps a lot and yawns like you do all day long. Baby gulps down amniotic fluid and fills the bladder for release – making sure the pipes are working."
