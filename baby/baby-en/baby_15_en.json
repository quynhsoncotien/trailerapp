Some also look like they are making a weird face like a grimace. The legs are now longer than the arms making a human silhouette versus a monkey-like version. The pancreas pumps out insulin, a hormone that regulates the blood sugar level. If your blood sugar is too high, that will make the baby pump out more insulin and cause it to be plumper than usual. However, this does not happen unless you have diabetes and elevated blood sugars. A condition known as gestational diabetes can occur, and you will be tested around 25 weeks to make sure all is well. Even though the eyelids are closed and fused, baby can sense light – just try a flashlight against the abdomen and see how the baby shifts and moves away from the light. He or she is not ready for the harsh realities of the world. Four and a half inches long, barely the size of your palm now."
