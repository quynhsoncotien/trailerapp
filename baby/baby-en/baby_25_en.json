  "content": "Almost one and a half pounds and over a foot long now, your baby is learning which way is up and down. Most babies ultimately end up head down, and that makes sense. How would you like sleeping with your head floating as opposed nestled low in the pelvis against the support of the pelvic bone? Some babies didn’t get that memo and end up feet first or sideways. The brain is getting smarter, and the hair color (if it can be seen) is present. Not all babies keep that color of hair, though. Baby is growing muscles and gaining more fat week by week. Time to make sure you have a pediatrician lined up and work on a birth plan, and then share the plan with your practitioner.  You may find that much of what you want is pretty standard. Don’t forget the classical music and reading to your sweet one."
