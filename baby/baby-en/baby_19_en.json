  "content": "The baby’s skin is getting thicker, and vernix (a whitish, greasy slime, like cold cream) is being made to cover it up for protection from chapping and wrinkling like you’ve been in the pool too long. All five senses are getting honed. Drop a glass or slam a door and see if you can get the baby to scold you with a thump. Some babies know exactly how to annoy you too, from digging fingers into the side of your uterus near a really big nerve to hiccups that won’t stop. Baby still looks skinny because the fat deposition occurs more in the third trimester. All the organs are too underdeveloped to survive outside its comfy home so keep tabs on your symptoms such as cramping – that’s not normal, and you should call your practitioner ASAP. The best time to evaluate the fetal heart is around this time especially if there is a family history of congenital birth defects, underlying diabetes, drug exposures, or a rapid or slow heartbeat. A fetal echocardiogram can detect subtle changes in the heart’s function and structure at this point. Very few people need this because heart defects are very uncommon – only 1% of babies have them, and most are relatively minor."
