Different organs mature at different times with the heart leading the way since it is the first one to begin to function in the 5th obstetric week of pregnancy. Unlike the lungs, liver, intestinal tract, and brain, most organs are not impacted by an early arrival. Kidneys, bladder, and genital tract are least likely to experience difficulty even when born severely premature at 24-25 weeks which is considered the lowest cutoff for survival as long as the weight is close to 500 grams or almost a pound. Of course, there are many more factors such as presence or absence of an infection, the reason for an early birth, and mode of delivery such as a cesarean section that factor into a baby’s ability to survive outside of the womb. Countless grandparents can attest to being born so small that they were put in a shoe box to sleep. Amazing! Keep drinking plenty of fluids because the amniotic fluid level depends on mom’s water intake. At 20 weeks, the baby weighs about 10 ounces."
