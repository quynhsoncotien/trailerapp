  "content": "This is a crucial week as are the next 6, because this is the make or break period when most losses occur. Early pregnancies are full of complex interactions of maternal hormones, the placenta, and the rapid formation of organs. A loss can occur even though you did everything perfectly. Do not worry, though. If there’s a heartbeat now, you’re in excellent shape, but it’s a good idea to wait until 12-14 weeks before telling the whole world about your contribution to the human race. The heartbeat cannot be heard with a doppler or stethoscope, but it can be seen on an ultrasound. The ultrasound machine can convert the visual signal to an audible one, allowing you to “hear” the heartbeat.  It looks like the entire tiny baby is beating, but that’s just due to the sound waves bouncing off a small object creating visual signals akin to fireworks. It is going very fast, twice as fast as an adult – more like a little mouse’s heartbeat. The brain is growing quickly, and brain waves can be detected while the eyes and nostrils are starting to form with little covers for protection. The skin is see-through, and if you were actually able to see up close, little lung buds and intestines have started their formation while the entire embryo is only a quarter of an inch large! This embryo looks completely different than the fetus – big head (compared to the body), eyes on the side of the head, no arms or legs…it’s a good thing this baby is inside where it can grow properly!"}
