Your ovary is getting ready for blastoff – yep, it’ll release an egg ripe for some healthy sperm that happens to be a hardy swimmer, eager to find a special place in the egg. No one knows for sure if the egg, the sperm, or if there must be a mutual agreement between the two for one sperm to penetrate the egg and merge their DNA – DNA is the stuff with all the chromosomes that determine traits of your baby. Last week an increase in the amount of estrogen and progesterone traveling through your bloodstream prompted your uterus to form a fluffy, blood-rich lining of tissue to receive and support a fertilized egg. At the same time, your ovaries, determine which egg sac gets selected for egg release. These fluid-filled sacs are called follicles. If you have regular, 28 day cycles, you will ovulate on day 14. The egg sac bursts open and the egg is picked up by the fallopian tube. During the next 12 to 24 hours, an egg will be fertilized if one of over hundreds of millions of sperm (on average) manages to swim all the way from your vagina through your cervix, heading north through your uterus to the fallopian tube, and penetrate the egg. Some accounts estimate that if a sperm were the size of a car, it could swim 60 miles per hour! However, sperm don’t live very long, not to mention some can’t swim very well and get stuck in the cervix in a quagmire of mucus. Millions of them hover around the outer surface of the egg, but only one can succeed in penetrating the egg’s outer membrane. The egg is massive compared to the sperm, which is three times smaller. Naturally, eggs have more volume to feed the fertilization and growth process as it multiplies into a zygote. Normally fertilized eggs now have 46 chromosomes (23 each from the sperm and egg). And as everyone knows, it's the sperm (XY) that determines the gender since the egg (XX) can only give an 'X'."}
