  "content": "Your baby is about 5 pounds now or the size of a grapefruit and is probably 18-19 inches long. He or she will probably not get any longer, but the fat will keep growing. Babies nowadays tend to be a bit bigger than 50 years ago when more mothers smoked. High pitched sounds are easiest for baby to hear. Movements will not slow down but may change in intensity since stretching and kicking are the results of bigger and stronger limbs. You may feel hungry all the time, but that will decrease the closer you get to your due date. Fingernails and toenails are present, and you swear he or she is digging a hole in your uterus. Watch for contractions and leakage of fluid because watery leakage fluid could mean your water broke. If you suspect that, call your practitioner. Hang in there, the end of pregnancy is closer than you think."
