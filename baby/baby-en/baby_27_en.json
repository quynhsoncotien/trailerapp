The lungs, liver, and immune system aren’t quite ready to do their job outside of the uterus, but he or she would still have an excellent survival rate if born now. Like baby seats, it’s best to stay strapped inside! The immune system gets more protection from the antibodies in mama’s milk so get those nipples ready. He or she will develop sleep-wake cycles and actually start to get a good night’s rest due to REM (rapid eye movement) sleep that begins at this time along with dreaming. Pray for a sound sleeper. They may even be looking around their home right now because the eyelids can open at 27 weeks. How cute is that?"
