A healthy meal plan remains necessary for all pregnancies, with the third trimester needing an additional 500 calories per day, relative to your daily intake before conception.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to fall for the notion that you just need to increase the volume the food on your table, but truth is, the core idea is in the added nutrient content, hence, additional calories in your system. \r\nYour weight fluctuations should be closely monitored, with your practitioner consulted in the event of more than a couple of pounds in a single week in your third trimester, or lack of recorded weight gain in consecutive weeks."
