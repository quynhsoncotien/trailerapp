As food aversion continues to jerk you around, you stay consistent with the smart idea of going for the alternatives and equivalents. Have a few quick picks for your consignment of bedside consignment such as dry cereal, pretzels, rice cakes, well-toasted bread, and breadsticks. Remember to watch out for crumbs on your bed or in the handbag.\r\n\r\nCravings are a consistent challenge, but here are some tricks to work around that. \r\n\r\nGive in. If the yearning is for fruits and vegetables, throw caution to the wind and dig in with abandon. Spice up the components by throwing in a few blueberries or strawberries to go with the mango madness. If the craving is for a burger, add a few healthy additives like sliced tomatoes and lettuce, a whole grain bun, or some cheese. Your taste buds may reject the bait, but give it a shot.\r\n\r\nStay safe. Sometimes, the cravings are for something you shouldnâ€™t be eating, so instead, go for the closest substitute. Staying within the healthy limits remains critical.\r\n\r\nRemember the vitamins and minerals. These key food components help you strike cravings.
