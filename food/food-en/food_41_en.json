It pays to remember that as long as your little one is in there, survival is impossible without the presence of necessary nutrients. \r\n\r\nRemember that your baby's brain is still developing, and fast. To fuel that brainpower, baby needs all the protein and omega-3s you can deliver. Finally, remain very keen on your nutritional needs. Remember that you're about to begin a physically tasking final stretch, labor, and you'll need all the energy you can muster. These vital calories will come from a structured diet right from start to finish, including smart dietary choices after delivery. Sure you can almost see that light at the end of the tunnel — but that doesn't mean you should put an end to your baby-focused diet. Keep eating for two, and concentrate on these last-minute nutritional needs: protein, iron, and DHA."
