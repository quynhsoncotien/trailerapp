A slow cooker can be the ultimate hack despite the name. You can toss in whatever you want to prepare, and come back at the end of the day to a delicious hot meal.  \r\n\r\nCleaning up is simple: rinse the pot and run it through the dishwasher. Always check for directions beforehand.\r\n\r\nMake smoothies with your blender, chop food with your food processor, and a toaster oven to swiftly warm anything. \r\n\r\nAnother hack is to cook in bulk and store all leftovers in the freezer. With lasagna, for instance, slice the leftovers and freeze for a feast at a later date. The same applies to soups. You can make a vat of minestrone and freeze in single-serve containers that can be reheated individually before consumption."
