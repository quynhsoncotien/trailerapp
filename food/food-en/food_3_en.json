  "content": "This week welcomes the baby to your body. The appropriate foods give you a head start to good health, for both you and your baby. Three servings of calcium-rich diet a day may even help you conceive. This critical nutrient is present in dairy products, fortified juices, broccoli, leafy green vegetables, sesame seeds, and canned salmon with bones. You also need at least 2 mg of manganese each day, which is critical for proper reproductive function. This component is found in spinach, carrots, broccoli, whole grains, nuts, bananas, and raisins.\r\n\r\nZinc is crucial for conception, with severe deficiencies resulting in impaired fertility. A daily intake of 15-20 mg a day is needed. This nutrient can be gotten through a supplement or by eating turkey, beef, lamb, pork, chicken, almonds, beans, wheat germ, yogurt, oatmeal, corn, eggs, fortified bread and cereals, and cooked shellfish, especially oysters. Fiber is essential in preventing constipation and hemorrhoids, and 25-35mg is required each day. Caffeine and alcohol should be avoided. \r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to assess the potency of herbal supplements and teas when it comes to fertility enhancement. There is the chance that some herbs may be harmful to you or your baby. Caution is necessary, and you should consult your doctor before using any of them."
