You may not always be in a position to cook at home so that you can have a balanced meal at a pleasant café. When at the restaurant, you can order certain foods, including salads and grilled veggies as a first course, or a sautéed leafy green such as spinach, escarole, or broccoli as a side.\r\n\r\nA bean, or vegetable soup on the menu, should be your next food item, so order a bowlful. While at it, you can get some tomato-based broths and chowders. Bisques and other cream soups should be avoided unless they come from milk or yogurt in place of heavy cream and butter. For purposes of surety, always ask. Any healthy side dish available can accompany your order."
