These food items will keep you going if you catch a brief bite. Lean meat should be at the top of your list. Not only do lean meats keep your blood sugar stable, but they also keep you full all through. Three servings each day will do, availing about 75mg of protein. Iron is crucial, with its ability to facilitate the development of the baby's red blood cells and nervous system. Your favorite lean meats should include lamb, pork, beef, veggie soups, and salads.\r\nFolate is essential to an expectant mother, right from conception, and this comes from lentils. Your daily supply of folate can also occur in the form of a folic acid supplement. As a critical ingredient in the development of your baby's brain and nervous system, it helps avoid congenital disabilities such as spina bifida. Lentils are an excellent source of iron as well, along with protein and vitamin B6.\r\n\r\nMilk is the ultimate source of calcium, but food aversions may pose a challenge in its consumption during pregnancy. Go for yogurt instead. Each day, a total of 1200 mg of calcium is needed for the expectant mother. Not just a calcium source, but yogurt contains folate as well.\r\n\r\nStay hydrated. All digestive processes overseeing the absorption of nutrients need water, along with your regular bodily functions."}
