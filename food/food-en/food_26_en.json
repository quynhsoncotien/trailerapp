Take a fruit cup, grilled chicken, or a scoop of brown rice to keep both mother and baby nourished.\r\n\r\nShop smart. It is wise to have a list of necessary items, some good picks from your set meal plan. This list is essential as it ensures you get all critical items before rushing to the aisles to get your regular staples. Get small packages, conveniently packed, and ready-to-nibble. Look for single-serve six- or eight-packs of yogurt, eight-ounce tubs of cottage cheese, individually wrapped string cheese, pre-cut fresh fruit salads, mini packs of baby carrots, small boxes or bags of raisins, nuts, dried fruit, and trail mix. \r\nHydration is crucial, so remember your consignment of small water bottles and some tomato and vegetable juice cans. These are convenient to carry around and come in handy regardless of where you are."
