The blood cells can absorb nutrients, which are then transported to your baby via the placenta. The constant hydration isn't just for you, but also for your baby. When you're expecting, the body temperature goes up, and this necessitates cooling by dispersing heat through sweating.\r\n\r\nA consistent flow of fluids is essential. Hydration ensures that fatigue is kept at a minimum and reduces headaches. Sufficient fluids are necessary as well to deal with the swelling of your ankles or other body parts. Expectant mothers in temperate climates are advised to take 12 or 13 glasses each day. When you're adequately hydrated, your urine is clear or pale."
