It is critical to have a suitable diet with nutrient-rich foods as well as healthy habits that keep both mother and baby in optimum health for nine months.\r\n\r\nTo start, it is vital to avoid alcohol, nicotine, and other drugs. The next thing that should leave your diet is fast food. All the fries, hot dogs, hamburgers, and such greasy foods need to go. It is wise for the mother-to-be to eat more baked foods instead of fried. It's essential to avoid too much salt, spice, coffee, and strong tea, as well as these, may affect your future pregnancy.\r\n\r\nMeat and fish should be cooked for at least 40 minutes to ensure that there are no vermin left. At this stage, fruits and vegetables are a core component of your diet. Folate is a crucial nutrient, with the synthetic form coming in folic acid. This B vitamin reduces the chances of neural-tube defects such as spina bifida by an impressive 70 percent. A daily minimum of 400 micrograms of folic acid is necessary, with 600-800 recommended for the first trimester. Folic acid supplements or prenatal vitamins (ask your doctor) absorb better than folate from foods, so this may be the best addition to your beans and legumes, fish, vegetables, poultry, and pork."
