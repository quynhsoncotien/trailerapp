You will notice that the swelling will manifest at certain hours, or after specific changes in weather, especially when temperatures go up. This phenomenon will usually go by the name edema, and it has a remedy, so no worries. Edema affects 75 per cent of women, and comes about as a result of fluid accumulation in the body and could be an indicator of preeclampsia. Have no fear, if your urine and blood pressure checks don't show anything off on your visit to the doctor.\r\nThe simple remedy to edema is adequate hydration. Target at least ten glasses daily, and this will remove all excess minerals like sodium from your body, along with other unwanted waste. It is imperative that you consume the required amount of salt, as a deficiency could set off swelling."
