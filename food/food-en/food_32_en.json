This task requires a unique diet plan to help create the perfect baby-growing environment. Aside from the specific vulnerabilities expectant mothers may face, all other standard health risks are constant.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, almost by reflex, the motherâ€™s immune system will have reduced capacity as it aims to accommodate a healthy baby with minimal chance of your body rejecting the baby. Predictably, a slightly weaker immune system will pose a noticeable health risk to the mother. This balance ensures an excellent environment for the fetus but endangers the mother health-wise.\r\nExisting physical limitations mean that you are incapable of storing vitamin C, with the implication being that you will need to source this vital nutrient and incorporate it into your diet. Present in many fresh fruits, a healthy level of vitamins is what you will get by integrating them into your meals and snacks. While at it, have some OJ daily to augment the fruit nutrients."
