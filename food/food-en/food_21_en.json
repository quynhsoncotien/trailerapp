Be it from spinach or supplements, it brings about more energy and guarantees a healthier body, which is excellent for the baby.\r\n\r\nAll pregnant women are susceptible to anemia, along with those that have had recent pregnancies, those carrying multiple fetuses, with those who have experienced malnourishment being at a higher risk.\r\n\r\nAn iron supplement is recommended during pregnancy, with an intake of 30 to 50 mg over the second half of the period. This supplement ensures that the baby gets proper nutrition and it is augmented with spinach, which can be served in a salad with fresh strawberries, under seared fish or grilled meat, or saut√©ed with pasta and cheese. Other sources include lean beef or buffalo, duck, cooked dry beans, edamame and other soy products, oat bran, barley, dried fruit, Jerusalem artichokes, and seaweed."
