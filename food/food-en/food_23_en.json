Set a target of at least eight cups a day, and above that on hot days that make you sweat a lot. Water is the best fluid for mother and baby. Taking water as the primary fluid is also pocket-friendly, and in many cases, you don't always need the bottled type as tap water is relatively safe to drink. For added purity, get a filter for your tap or employ the use of filtered pitchers.\r\n\r\nMoney that could have gone to juice can be used to purchase frozen concentrate in place of refrigerated cartons. The concentrate is then mixed with water.\r\n\r\nEat frequently. Keep up the distributed sittings in your feeding schedule, ensuring that you donâ€™t take too much in a single sitting. Overeating will make you feel overstuffed, and with the baby growing, stomach space will progressively become limited. This extra stuffing may bring about bloating and gas, heartburn, and general discomfort in your digestive system."
