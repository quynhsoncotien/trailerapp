As a critical nutrient in milk, calcium is essential during pregnancy, especially for the baby's bone development.\r\n\r\nA simple answer is available for this challenge, and all you need to do is go for other dairy products. Yogurt, for instance, has a similar calcium content as regular milk, along with cheese. Other products also contain this critical nutrient, such as canned salmon, fortified fruit juice, leafy greens, and broccoli. \r\nMilk will usually give a supply of Vitamin D as well, but this is much easier to get. The simple task on your end is to go out in the sunshine, and your body will get its daily supply of the vitamin."
