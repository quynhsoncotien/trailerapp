Besides, semolina, white rice, cookies, biscuits, sweet yogurts and cottage cheese desserts into your diet. \r\n\r\nThere are unverified claims that castor oil induces labor. Whichever way, it does have a gross taste. It is certain though that castor oil affects your bowels more than your uterus. That's the same case with herbal preparations such as red raspberry leaf tea, which is said to tone and relax the uterus.\r\n\r\nThere is no proof that either is safe or effective. Any intention to use one or both should get the backing from your doctor. Once in labor, go with snacks that are easily digestible. Avoid meat and dairy, as these take longer and will divert energy meant to facilitate a complication-free delivery. If you need anesthesia, a full stomach will prove problematic."
