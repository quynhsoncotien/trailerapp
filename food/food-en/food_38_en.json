Research has shown that the brain of an expectant mother does shrink in volume, particularly during the third trimester, but then again increases in size after delivery.\r\n\r\nTo keep your memory sharp in this trimester, you need extra choline! A daily intake of 450 mg will do the trick. You'll probably get some from your prenatal vitamin, but it doesn't hurt to take an extra step to be sure. Your choline levels can be boosted by eating such choline-rich foods like egg yolks (use DHA eggs rich in Omega-3), beef, milk, soybeans (enjoy them in their crunchy roasted form or steamed in yummy green pods), citrus fruits, wheat germ, and nuts.\r\n\r\nIf you are breastfeeding, it is advised to keep these levels up even after delivery, because nursing mothers need even more choline in their breastfeeding diet. After birth, take 550 mg of choline each day."
