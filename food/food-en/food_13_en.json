{"week":13,"reading_time":120000,"content":"This week is the start of the second trimester, and your choice of foods starts determining the smell of amniotic water. On your 13th obstetric week, your weight is critical, and putting on a few extra pounds is right for your pregnancy. However, this should be done with tact, giving careful attention to the scale of added weight and when the pounds are supposed to be piled on.  \r\n\r\nA weight increase that is higher than the recommended limit puts you at risk for gestational diabetes, hypertension and other challenges up to the point of delivery. Keep in mind that extra weight comes with stretch marks, with the task of shedding quite some pounds after delivery. A minor gain risks premature birth or an underweight baby. It's also likely to bring about other issues during the pregnancy. Maintain a right balance for your and the baby's health."}
