For this reason, the sort of diet that you keep could have far-reaching effects, which you will want to be all positive.\r\n\r\nThe first nutrient group you will want to have enough of is protein. The baby-growing process will affect your body, and push you to the limit at times. Protein is the safety net you need. With enough protein, there will be less wear and tear to your system as the baby grows. Meats and animal products are excellent sources of protein, with split peas, lentils and nuts packing a punch.\r\n\r\nEnergy is a consistent requirement as the body will usually feel tired during pregnancy, and you need complex carbohydrates to keep you going. To maintain that spring in your step, keep up your intake of fruits, vegetables, peas, as well as cooked dried beans.\r\n\r\nIron-deficiency anemia affects quite some expectant mothers, with the symptoms including fatigue. The body needs a right amount of blood to sustain the pregnancy comfortably, and you should have your share of at least 18mg of iron a day. Eat spinach, cereals, lean red meat, and shellfish."
