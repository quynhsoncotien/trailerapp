Ensure that you stick to sound eating habits, employing a diet rich in proteins, calcium, and vitamins. It should also contain fresh and dried fruits, veggies, and both white and red meat, which are perfect for the baby. Yogurt and dried plums help keep constipation at bay. \r\n\r\nAvoid sweets, buns, chocolate, coffee, and carbonated drinks.\r\n\r\nAs always, stay properly hydrated."
