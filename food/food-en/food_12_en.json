You need the extra calories with the baby on board, about 300 in the first trimester and up to 500 in the third. Your practitioner's recommendations will depend on your weight at the beginning of the pregnancy. To optimize calcium intake, endeavor to eat foods rich in vitamin D, which improves absorption.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, you need a good supply of Omega-3, found in salmon and other cold water fish. The body is incapable of manufacturing these fatty acids, and they're significant in aiding the digestion of vitamin A and E. Fatty acids help avoid prenatal depression and facilitate the development of the baby's brains and eyes. Both the FDA and EPA recommend a daily target of between 8 and 12 ounces of fish weekly for expectant mothers. Foods rich in Omega-3 are the best, served with acidic ingredients like sour cream, lemon juice, or salsa.\r\n\r\nFruits, whether fresh or dried should remain a constant presence in your diet."}
