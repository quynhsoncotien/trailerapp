A well-balanced diet consists of your supply of fresh fruits and vegetables, and a well-hydrated body is in prime position to properly absorb all the nutrients efficiently.\r\n\r\nHealthy eating not only involves having certain foods in your meal plan but also translates to knowing the types of items to keep away from your table.

Any fish gotten from unclean water bodies should stay off your plate.\r\n\r\nFish remains the critical source of Omega-3 fats, with Salmon, in particular, a leading supplier of the same, although you should go for wild, as farmed fish may contain unwanted PCBs.

Remember to use a separate chopping board for your veggies and fish."
