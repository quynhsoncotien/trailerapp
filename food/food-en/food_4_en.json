Consumption of nicotine, alcohol and pills is highly discouraged.\r\n\r\nThe neurological development of your baby is critical, and the brain of the growing fetus needs to grow as well correctly. For this reason, Omega-3 is essential. The presence of this component in your diet ensures good vision, sharp memory and deep language comprehension for your baby right from early childhood. Having Omega-3 in your diet reduces the chances of experiencing post-partum depression. Omega-3 fortified eggs, walnuts and flaxseed oil are excellent sources of ALA, a type of Omega-3 fatty acid.\r\n\r\nGreat caution is necessary when choosing the ideal fish for an expectant mother. Generally, all huge, ocean predators are a no-no. The guiding principle is to stay away from the fish with high mercury levels, as well as those sourced from contaminated water bodies. Augment your fish diet with fish oil supplements."
