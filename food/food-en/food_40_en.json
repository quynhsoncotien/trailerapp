Some practitioners may discourage food once contractions begin, but many will give no such restrictions, especially at the beginning of labor, and sometimes all through. The permitted consignment will consist of mainly snacks and fluids, definitely not a steak dinner.\r\n\r\nStudies have established that women who are allowed to eat experience shorter labor by between 45 and 90 minutes. Labor is hard work, and this daunting task demands calories. An empty stomach may make it challenging to pull off those last pushes. Once given the go-ahead to take something, think small, or go with your practitionerâ€™s recommendations. Snacks will keep your energy up, and fluids ensure your hydration.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you will want to avoid all high-fat foods or anything that's full of fiber. All your energy should remain focused on a flawless delivery. Resist the temptation to grab a bite on your way to the hospital, regardless of how hungry you may feel."
