The body will actively work to keep certain foods out of the system as you take initiatives to eat right and stay healthy. Have no fear, for your brain, will allow you to keep down similar food items that are just as healthy as or better than the worse unhealthy options you crave, can't keep down, or those that cause bloating.\r\n\r\nHealthier alternatives to your usual sweet or salty foods can be a vital part of your diet, coupled with a little – sometimes a lot – of willpower. These foods are a critical cog in both you and your baby's health. Protein is critical, and you may experience aversion to chicken and beef for instance. The smartest move is to go for more palatable forms of protein-rich foods such as yogurt, beans, cottage cheese, or soy products. Quinoa is a great option as well. Take yellow vegetables as well: carrots, yams, or go for the beta-carotene in cantaloupe, mango, peaches, and apricots.\r\n\r\nStay hydrated. However, fluids such as coffee, tea, juice, lemonade aren’t the very best choice. Instead, go for fresh, not too cold water."
