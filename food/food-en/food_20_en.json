This hormone is critical in keeping a healthy pregnancy, but it also comes with the unpleasant bloating, burping, and farting.\r\n\r\nHere’s how you cope with bloating:\r\n\r\nDrink plenty of water. This influx of fluid clears all system channels to avoid congestions that result in bloating\r\n\r\nRemember the fiber. Leafy greens, legumes, whole grains, and fruits are critical. Too much intake of these, however, can cause gas. If initially absent, fiber should be introduced gradually.\r\n\r\nTake smaller meals. Large amounts of food translate to a more significant amount of gas. Meals can be split into three medium-sized sittings, with two or three snacks in between. This distribution prevents overloading of the digestive system, and is an effective way of avoiding gas.\r\n\r\nRelax when eating. Anxious eating results in a lot of swallowed gas. Relaxation is critical when having your meals. It is a smart move to stop and take a few breaths before and during your meal. The term ‘lunch break' hints at taking a break when having your meal, don't be afraid of having one."
