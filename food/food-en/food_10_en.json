It is therefore of crucial importance that you focus on the foods that help you keep it in check. \r\n\r\nFiber-rich foods. Also known as roughage, these will help you eliminate waste. Eat whole-grain cereals and bread, peas, beans, fresh fruits and veggies (raw or lightly cooked — preferably with skin left on) and dried fruits.\r\n\r\nGo for the green. These are not only in the form of green vegetables but in a juicy, sweet kiwi, a tiny fruit that packs a potent laxative effect. Aim for 25 to 35 grams of fiber each day. You can read food labels if you want, but there's no need to do the math, choose lots of high fiber foods.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative that you stay away from those classic cloggers and refined grains like white bread, white rice, refined cereals, and pasta.\r\n\r\nDon't max out at mealtime. Big meals are bound to burden your digestive tract, leading to traffic jams. Try eating six mini-meals a day rather than three large ones. Smaller portions taken at intervals reduces the chances of gas and bloating.\r\n\r\nHydrate often. Eight full glasses of fluids – could be water, vegetable or fruit juice or broth – each day will keep solids moving through your digestive tract at an impressive rate and keep your stool soft and more comfortable to pass.\r\n\r\nVitamins, minerals, folic acid are vital, so make sure you’ve got enough of them for development of the baby’s cells and internals."
