The brain is a critical cog in the daily routines of the body, and the baby needs a well-developed one to be able to walk, breathe, talk, and interact with the environment.  \r\n\r\nOver the course of pregnancy, three servings of protein are required daily, equivalent to 75 grams of the nutrient. This target is usually achievable with minimum fuss by many. \r\n\r\nIn the final trimester, the necessary amount of protein must be availed to the body, as the baby’s development is at a very critical stage. An increase in the protein intake is recommended, with your usual sources backed by Omega-3 fatty acids, like DHA, which is good for the baby’s brain and reduces chances of postpartum depression.\r\n\r\nGet protein during pregnancy from grass-fed lean meat, poultry, fish – fatty fish, like wild salmon, anchovies, and sardines contain the most brain-boosting fatty acids, but all fish have some – eggs(go for DHA eggs for an omega-3 boost), milk and other dairy products."
