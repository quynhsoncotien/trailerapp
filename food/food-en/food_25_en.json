{"week":25,"reading_time":120000,"content":"During pregnancy, gaining weight is easy. For other expectant mothers though, the concern is not being able to gain enough. Less weight may be caused by metabolism, body issues, morning sickness, aversion, or other medical reasons, but failure to put on enough pounds leaves you vulnerable to complications during pregnancy. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t panic, your doctor or nutritionist can create a meal plan for you.\r\n\r\nEat more calories. Focus on quality, giving attention to small portions that pack a punch. Take foods that have healthy fats, such as avocados and nuts, along with higher-calorie grains and legumes such as denser whole-wheat bread, whole-grain cereal, pasta, beans, and peas.\r\n\r\nSkip the salads and low-calorie items for now. These items should come after the course, as they may lower your appetite if taken first. Stick to the rich nutrient and calorie sources like dried apricots, eaten instead of broccoli.\r\n\r\nIn extreme cases, expectant mothers may develop hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe vomiting and nausea, usually more debilitating than the usual morning sickness. The condition makes it impossible to keep food down, so immediately consult your doctor when it strikes."}
