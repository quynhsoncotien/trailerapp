It is advisable to avoid â€˜eating for two,' as this tendency results in weight gain during pregnancy for a lot of women. It's also important to avoid skipping meals. If you skip a meal, the baby goes hungry as well. Get into a three-square routine, so that when the baby's finally onboard, a steady supply of nutrients throughout the day is guaranteed.\r\n\r\nAn objective, unbiased view of your diet is necessary. An honest assessment of your dietary habits will help you determine those that may complement or hinder your quest for a healthy diet. You can share the details of your daily eating habits, enlisting the help of a dietitian to know if any habits need reshaping. Find joy in taking the right foods. These foods will include salads, yummy yellows such as papaya, mangoes, and apricots, and hearty whole grains."
