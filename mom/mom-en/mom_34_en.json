Your uterus is still expanding continuously, and at 34 weeks pregnant, it is about five inches above your navel now. You may notice a burning right below your rib cage that is terribly annoying. Try massaging the area and change positions. If you have not already experienced carpal tunnel syndrome, it may start at this point. With all the swelling, the hands become numb as the nerve in the wrist gets pinched. It makes it really difficult to write for any length of time. So, if you want to record some of your hopes and dreams about your pregnancy and baby to share later in life, start a video recording on your phone and send it off to your email for safe keeping.\r\n\r\nShare your feelings when you first found out you were pregnant, your first ultrasound, the heartbeat, the first movement, all the special events and memories preceding the birth. Oh, and one more thing, seriously consider your pain-relief options in labor. Many women prefer to go ‘au natural’ without chemicals but keep your options open. I mean, birthing a baby is akin to passing a kidney stone. There is absolutely no reason to suffer when there are safe options. Find out what your practitioner recommends and get more information. And, this is not a joint decision between you and your partner! Your partner should support your decision. It’s your body, so make sure you take care of it. Everyone’s pain tolerance is different, and each labor is different. For example, if the baby is positioned ‘posterior’, the pain can be doubled."
