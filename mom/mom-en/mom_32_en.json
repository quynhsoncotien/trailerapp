These pre-labor rehearsals are experienced earlier and with more intensity in women who've been pregnant before. Try getting up if you’re lying down or walking if you’ve been sitting. If they start to get painful, stronger, or don’t go away after changing positions, call your practitioner. Real labor often feels like period cramps that start in the back and spread to the front. They tend to last 45 seconds or more and are regular.  One thing you can do is take a warm bath to help with the discomfort.\r\n\r\nLearn the signs of labor such as leakage of watery fluid or water breaking, period-like cramps, vaginal bleeding, loose stools, and a tightening feeling in your uterus that makes it feel hard like the tip of your nose.\r\n\r\nWith your big uterus crowding your insides, you may find your appetite waning now. Try to eat regular, small snacks – a bite of a banana counts! – instead of big meals."
