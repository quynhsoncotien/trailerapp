You should be feeling awesome (after all, the second trimester doesn't get its reputation for being the most comfortable of the three trimesters for nothing).\r\n\r\nBut if you're not feeling better yet, don't worry.  Unfortunately for some women, bloating, constipation, headaches and breast tenderness can continue to some degree throughout pregnancy. If you think your belly is too big, it's because your uterus is peaking over the pubic bone and heading towards your lower abdomen. You might even be able to feel the top of it if you press a little deeper. Don’t be afraid – there’s plenty of protection to your little person who is now able to move his or her chin off the chest by now. Your practitioner can probably hear the heartbeat with a hand-held device called a fetal doppler which is just sound waves that make noises by bouncing off the baby’s heart muscles to detect the heartbeat – usually 140-160 per minute. High or low, it doesn’t determine the gender of the baby despite silly wives' tales."
