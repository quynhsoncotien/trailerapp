You are hot, uncomfortable, live in the bathroom and look for any conceivable sign that labor is imminent. Feet hurt, hands are swollen, and you can’t even recognize your face – who is that puffball?\r\n\r\nSo, what are the true signs of labor? These include the rupture of the membranes (water breaking) that releases your amniotic fluid – it could be a trickle or a huge gush; diarrhea or nausea; spurts of activity around the house or the nesting instinct); the loss of the mucous plug (the “cork” of mucus that seals the opening of the uterus); and the bloody show (your capillaries rupture from the dilation and effacement of your cervix, causing any discharge to appear pink or red-tinged).\r\n\r\nOnce you've seen a bloody show, real labor is soon to follow, but not a definite thing. Did I tell you to recheck that bag you packed and make sure the dog or cat are properly taken care of when you are gone? That's what grandparents are for."
