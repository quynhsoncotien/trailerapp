Baby has hopefully settled into the headfirst position, but sometimes the little buggers wait until the last minute. The threat of a cesarean section can even make them switch from breech to headfirst. As your baby gets settled into a proper (you hope) position for birth, the extra pressure can lead to the sciatic nerve becoming inflamed. This can cause you to experience sharp, shooting pain, tingling, achiness, or numbness that starts in your butt and radiates down the back of your legs â€“ otherwise known as sciatica. Try not to sleep curled in a ball or sit for long periods of time, as that puts the sciatica nerve on stretch. A heating pad, a warm bath, or just some self-imposed bed rest can help with the discomfort. The blood volume of pregnancy dilutes the iron level in your blood, but anemia is rare. However, your practitioner will tell you if you are deficient. Some iron-rich foods: chicken, beans, spinach, tofu, beef and enriched cereals are great options because iron supplements aggravate constipation. Time for the diabetes screen if it wasn't done at 26 weeks."
