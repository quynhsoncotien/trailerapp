The first obstetric week of pregnancy does not start at the time of fertilization of the egg or with implantation of the fertilized egg. In fact, the first week is usually when you are bleeding from a normal menstrual flow and not even thinking about pregnancy. By convention, you are given 2 weeks gratis to take into account the time for ovulation (egg release) which is about two weeks from when your last period began. For most women, itâ€™s about 13-14 days. Confusing to most women, but it makes sense to calculate the pregnancy this way because years ago before ultrasounds, no one had any way of knowing exactly when an egg was fertilized. Now with artificial reproductive technologies (test-tube pregnancies), the exact day of fertilization can be known. Your due date is either 40 weeks from your last menstrual period or 38 weeks from ovulation."
