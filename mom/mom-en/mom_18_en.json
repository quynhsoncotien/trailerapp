In a couple of weeks, your practitioner will start measuring the height of the uterus by placing one end of a measuring tape on your pubic bone and the other at the top of the uterus. This is done in centimeters and corresponds roughly to your gestational age. 20 centimeters equals 20 weeks along. You are probably noticing other changes now such as an increase in vaginal discharge. This is due to hormones. Estrogen makes it thinner, and later, it will thicken due to progesterone. Some women have a glowing complexion throughout their pregnancy, but if you are the unlucky one to have acne now, rest assured that as the hCG level starts to fall closer to the third trimester, it will clear up.\r\n\r\nAnd another thing kicks in around now, and that is low back pain. As the uterus pushes further upward and backward, it changes how you walk and stand erect. Another hormone known as relaxin loosens joints in your hips and spine which can leave you with backaches and pains. You can also injure muscles more easily because of this increase in flexibility. \r\n\r\nEat smaller meals and snacks now and do sit upright for a few hours after eating. This will help decrease heartburn if you stay away from jalapenos."
