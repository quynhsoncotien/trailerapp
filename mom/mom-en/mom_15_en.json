It’s probably just a reflex or an accident and once it happens, baby thinks it’s kind of cool or maybe they’re just bored. Baby is now just 5 inches in length, 2 ounces, so it’s hard to believe that you may have gained 5 or more pounds by now. Not to worry, just eat sensibly, increase your fiber, fruits, veggies, and lean meats. Many women get another ultrasound at 15 weeks or later. This is the perfect time to learn the gender if you want to. Make sure you ask your doctor if he or she sees a ‘turtle’ sign or the ‘hamburger’ sign – turtle, it’s a boy, hamburger, it’s a girl."
