They are red, pink, blue-purple marks and usually start in the lower part of your abdomen. It’s mostly genetic so if sisters and Mother had them, you may get them too. It's caused by rapid collagen stretching, sort of like a slinky toy. Once you pull the slinky rings too far apart, they won’t go back to their original shape. Your skin loses its elasticity. Cocoa butter coat them if you want, but the problem is internal. The baby is still too little and immature to survive outside of the womb, and starts to develop vernix to cover the skin surface that protects the skin from the amniotic fluid (it looks like cold cream). Amniotic fluid is made from both the placenta and fetal urine. I know this sounds gross, but the baby swallows the fluid and pees it out. It’s completely harmless because the fluid is sterile inside the bag of water. And of course, the baby’s lungs are fluid filled until birth. That means that you supply oxygen from your blood to the baby via the umbilical cord."
