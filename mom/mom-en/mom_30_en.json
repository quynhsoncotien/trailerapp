  "content": "Many of the early pregnancy symptoms you thought were finished start coming back to aggravate you, like the need to pee all the time especially if the baby's head is now pressing on your bladder, along with tender breasts (as they gear up for milk production), fatigue and pregnancy heartburn.\r\n\r\nPregnancy hormones cause your body's muscles to relax so you can deliver your baby, and they also affect the muscle in the esophagus. The result: heartburn and indigestion with the large uterus adding to the problem. \r\n\r\nThe solution? Avoid foods that can cause digestive discomfort (spicy foods, fatty or fried foods, chocolate), eat smaller meals and don't lie down while eating or right after eating. You can take antacids but talk to your practitioner about other options. Birth is the only solution for some mothers.\r\n\r\nBreathless? Your growing baby is pressing against your diaphragm. Try sleeping in a semi-seated position, with pillows propping up your back, and talk more slowly. Put away the heels! Your shifting sense of gravity and loosening joints leave you clutzier than usual. Prevent falls by wearing flats and watching your step."
