Your baby is learning new skills that he or she will use later in life – including pedaling against your belly, a sort of pre-walking skill.\r\n\r\nNow that you are two-thirds of the way through your pregnancy, the top of your uterus, or fundus is about three inches above your belly button. This fundal height is how your doctor will evaluate adequate fetal growth. And speaking of your belly button, have you noticed that it's taken on a life of its own – a larger-than-life life, but it's de rigueur for the pregnant set. Have no fear, your belly button should revert to its regular position a few months after delivery.\r\n\r\nIf a full night's rest has become elusive, welcome to the (sleepless) world of pregnancy insomnia. Between heartburn and leg cramps, bathroom runs and that big beach ball beneath your nightie, it's no wonder your body's having trouble calming down and drifting off. Limit eating and fluids before bedtime to prevent nocturnal awakenings."
