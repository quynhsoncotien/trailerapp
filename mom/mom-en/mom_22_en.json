Skip the heels because you are more at risk for falls due to your balance issues. You’ve probably noticed that your shoes no longer fit. That’s because the feet may grow almost a full-size during pregnancy as a result of the hormone relaxin. They don’t shrink back either. The bones and ligaments of your feet loosen up just like the pelvic bones. Personally, I think that the longer you live and walk on this earth, the bigger the feet get, anyhow. I noticed 20 years later after my last child, that my shoe size went up another half size. Weight and gravity must play a role."
