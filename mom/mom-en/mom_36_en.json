You will also be swabbed for group B streptococcus (GBS) which is a harmless bacterium to you but can cause serious infections to your newborn. If you are a carrier, you will be given IV antibiotics in labor. The cervix is evaluated for dilation – it has to get to 10 centimeters before the baby can be born, but when you start getting to 3-4 cm, usually you are in early labor – but it can start and stop. The cervix is also checked for softness and thickness - called effacement. Softening and thinning out are usually the earliest phases of cervical change, followed by dilation. So, don’t despair if you are closed, thick, and high – it can change in a matter of hours. The station of the baby means how far out of the pelvis the baby’s head is – as in high, mid, or low. The countdown has begun, you are officially in your last month of pregnancy! By now, you are totally over this process and cannot wait for baby to get a move on. However, a few more weeks of percolation are truly best for your baby.  \r\n\r\nIf the baby is head down, which is something your doctor will want to know now, there is a high likelihood that the pelvic pressure and pain are pretty intense. It’s time to walk less, rest more, and figure out a way to get comfortable. Lay on your left side with hips elevated, use warm compresses. It’s best not to make long car trips because sitting in one place is maddening. Plane rides are out, too. What if my baby has not dropped into a headfirst position? Well, your doctor will do an ultrasound to see if the baby is breech or horizontal. Even a breech baby now can suddenly turn before the onset of labor. If not, the doctor may suggest a ‘version’ which is a way for the doctor to physically manipulate your baby through the abdomen. Some turn easily, others not."
