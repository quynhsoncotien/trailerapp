Now is the time to start a program to soothe the nerves. Yoga is a fabulous de-stressor if you have time to take a class. You can get a brain fog during pregnancy. So, it's a good idea to schedule regular exercise and talk to other women who have been through pregnancy.  Now, you may be noticing a strange dark line running down the middle of your body from the belly button. It's called the 'linea nigra' or dark line.\r\n\r\nSome women (more often darker-skinned ones) notice discoloration on the face too, especially in the area around the nose, forehead, cheeks, and eyes. It's called the mask of pregnancy because it appears as a mask-like configuration on the face.\r\n\r\nDon’t worry – all these skin discolorations will fade within a few months after delivery.\r\nAnd the darned insomnia is maddening. Try putting pillows between your legs and lie on your left side with a pillow wedged under a small part of the back so that you are neither on your back or wholly on your side. It's a favorite technique that nurses use in the Labor suite."
