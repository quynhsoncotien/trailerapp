  "content": "The constant urge to urinate should start to improve as you head towards your second trimester. This is because your uterus is rising out of the pelvis. However, that frequent urge comes back in late pregnancy. Your super-tender breasts and nipples, food aversions, fatigue, and nausea should diminish but will be replaced with cravings and increased appetite. Another curious problem starts up especially in the middle of the second trimester and that is feeling woozy and dizzy; this is especially prominent when you stand in one place for too long or get up out of a bed or a chair too quickly. It's best to step from side to side if you must stand in one place.\r\n\r\nAt the 12th obstetric week, your doc may be able to feel your growing uterus by touching your abdomen, but you may not look pregnant. Your uterus is almost the size of a small cantaloupe now. Try stretchy waistbands and empire or sun dresses till itâ€™s time for maternity clothes."
