So, don't go overboard just because you're eating for two. Try to gain efficiently by choosing the most nutritious foods during pregnancy and minimizing the junk. At 13 weeks pregnant, your lower abdomen is probably just starting to protrude a bit too. You're probably finding your jeans aren't buttoning without a struggle. \r\n\r\nAre your two favorite positions these days sitting and lying down? Pregnancy fatigue is normal. That's because you're running a baby-making factory that's in business 24/7. And for the next few weeks, baby is not the only thing growing â€“ so is the placenta, the magnificently complex mission control that will serve as your baby's life-support system until delivery. As a result of the efficient placenta, you will soon become energized to get things done, maybe even start up an exercise program. It's perfectly safe to do, too. Remember to pre-hydrate and do not overheat."
