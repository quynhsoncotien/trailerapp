It depends on the location of the placenta and the position of the baby. When the baby kicks facing towards your back, it's more difficult to perceive the movements. If the placenta is closest to the front of the uterus, then external belly kicks or movements may be only felt later in pregnancy when the baby gets stronger and bigger. \r\n\r\nAlso, an inaccurate due date can have you doubting whether that was your baby’s momentous first kick. Don't worry, the baby eventually gets big enough to pack a serious punch.\r\n\r\nUnpleasant things can occur, such as leg cramps that are painful spasms in your calves. They usually occur at night and can accompany restless leg syndrome which is maddening. Literally, every time you try to lie still, your legs will seem agitated or start tingling – this can lead to serious sleep problems as you toss and turn to make them go away. \r\n\r\nWhatever the cause, the quick fix to a 'charley horses' is to extend your leg or straighten it and gently flex your ankle and toes back toward your shins. Give it a minute even though it hurts at first, but it works."
