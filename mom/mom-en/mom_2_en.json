On the first day of menses, your hormone levels are at their lowest, while the pituitary gland (a tiny organ in the brain) is priming for release of more FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) which stimulates the follicles (little egg cysts) in the ovary to grow prior to ovulation. Believe it or not, there are only about 3-4 fertile days in any given cycle. It is the 2 days before and the day of ovulation that constitute the fertile period. Once the egg is released, the chance for a sperm to fertilize the egg drops dramatically. It is vitally important to make sure there is sperm available before releasing the egg and that can be a little tricky for most couples.\r\n\r\nAssuming all is going well, and an egg is released, the sperm have about 24 hours to find the egg. Sadly, most die well before they get near the fallopian tube, though. Only one strong sperm can penetrate the egg. At that point, the fallopian tube moves the fertilized egg known as a blastocyst (bundle of baby cells) towards the uterus where it buries itself in the wall; this is called implantation."
