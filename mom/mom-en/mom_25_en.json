  "content": "At 25th obstetric weeks of pregnancy, your rapidly expanding uterus has now reached the size of a soccer ball and is stretching your skin to the point of itching. This itching can be relieved by moisturizer or even calamine lotion.\r\n\r\nAnother annoying source of itchiness is in the rectum as the uterus presses on all the blood vessels beneath it. Hemorrhoids are dilated rectal veins and can cause pain, itching, and bleeding. Chronic constipation is the likely cause, and the best way to minimize it is to not strain or sit on the toilet a long time. Increase fruit, fiber, and water intake. Doing pelvic floor exercises (Kegel exercises) can help too. In the meantime, try witch hazel pads or ice packs to soothe your sore bottom â€“ and keep in mind they should go away after delivery.\r\n\r\nOther infections such as vaginitis may also be linked to premature births. So, be sure to report any itching or unusual vaginal discharge to your doctor."
