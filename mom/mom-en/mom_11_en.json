Think lemon or lime because that’s the size of your little dumpling now-could fit nicely in the palm of your hand. And speaking about odors – citrus might help with that. Even your significant other can take on a smell that you never noticed before. Turn up the air conditioner or open the window, whatever it takes to make it through this ordeal. Another interesting tidbit is that your little one really looks like a little human being except for that belly button area. The umbilical cord looks massive now but that’s because the fetal intestines are still hanging outside of the baby’s abdominal wall, getting ready to be brought inside around 12 weeks. I know, it’s weird, but completely expected and normal. It’s about time for your next prenatal visit. During the first 28 weeks, visits with your practitioner usually occur every 4 weeks. Blood work is usually done in the first trimester or between 15 and 18 weeks, and then again around 26 weeks to test for diabetes, anemia, and sometimes syphilis."
