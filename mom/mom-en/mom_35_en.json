Do not worry unless you are having blurred vision, seeing spots, or having headaches. Again, first pregnancies have a small chance of developing preeclampsia \u2013which is a blood pressure disorder that causes protein to spill in your urine. The cause is unknown, but it does warrant a trip to your doctor\u2019s office and may be cause for induction if it is severe. An induction means that your labor will be artificially started with either topical medications to soften your cervix or IV meds. Baby is bigger than a grapefruit by now and probably weighs 5-6 pounds. All that weight and the pressure means frequent urination of tiny bits of urine. It\u2019s so annoying because you\u2019ll feel like the bladder is full and all that comes out is a few drops! Then as soon as you get dressed, the pee comes out unexpectantly if you cough, laugh, or walk too fast. Keep a panty liner handy or a change of undies. Remember, it\u2019s waddle time until after the baby is born. The longer the baby stays inside, the better it is because full-term babies eat and sleep better. Premature babies (any babies born before 37 weeks) have a higher chance of complications, too. And let\u2019s face it, the baby is much easier to care for in your uterus because once out \u2013 you\u2019ll be attending to the baby 24\/7."}
