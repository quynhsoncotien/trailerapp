The second trimester is the best for relaxing pre-baby vacations because once born, that vacation is no walk in the park. \r\n\r\nMost airlines are fine if you bring a doctor's note, but some will not let women fly past 32 weeks. Babies have been born a mile high.\r\n\r\nNow is time to schedule your childbirth education class and breastfeeding class if you haven't already done so. Meditation, yoga, and exercise are three of the best activities to improve your mental and physical health. Ever heard of diastasis recti? Probably not. \r\n\r\nThere are large muscles in your abdomen that run from the rib cage to the pubic bone, called the rectus muscles.  Excessive pressure inside the abdomen can cause these muscles to spread enough that they donâ€™t contract well, and the belly pooches out.  Although this most often happens because of pregnancy, it can also happen in women who have never been pregnant, and even in men.  If not severe, improving the core muscles may help once baby is born.  Severe cases may require surgery."
