I've even known people to have baby names selected by a poll. You probably already know the name or have two in mind, but some people wait until they see their little munchkin. Just two more weeks, and hopefully not a day longer. But we all know that is not the case for most expecting parents. Usually, if this is your first baby, he or she will drop into position and relieve the pressure on your lungs and stomach before going into labor whereas second-time moms ‘drop’ at the onset of labor. Relief from bloat, heartburn, and breathlessness will be replaced with frequent bathroom trips and rectal discomfort. Sleepless nights, leaky breasts, stuffy noses are just a few more insults that must be tolerated waiting for your precious cargo. Braxton Hicks contractions will increase, but actual labor will be elusive. There tends to be a couple of false alarms, but real labor does not stop, gets stronger, more painful, and closer together. Usually, 10 or more painful contractions for a couple of hours is a sign of early labor. If they go away with walking, you are not in labor. Have a chocolate Sunday and watch your favorite TV show – because those days will be long gone when Junior arrives."
