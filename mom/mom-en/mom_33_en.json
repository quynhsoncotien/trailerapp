{"week":33,"reading_time":120000,"content":"Just when you need the rest the most, insomnia kicks in for about three in four pregnant women. Rather than getting more anxious about the lack of sleep, try a few things like a warm bath, reading, moving to another room or couch, or wake your partner up for some sex. Yes, sex is safe during pregnancy and can be done up until your water breaks or labor starts (unless your practitioner has told you otherwise). It may take some maneuvering for the right position, but it will help relax your body and mind. You might even ask for a massage if sex is too uncomfortable. This late-onset insomnia might be Mother Nature\u2019s way of getting you ready for those 2 am feedings. Sometimes, hunger itself is the reason for insomnia and taking a trip to the kitchen for a light snack might be the best solution. Try something easy to digest such as cereal or toast. You don\u2019t want anything too heavy but have at that leftover donut if you must. \r\n\r\nYour food choices now may not follow all the rules, but that\u2019s ok. Keep taking your prenatal vitamins (the doctor prescribed) that contain omega-3 fatty acids or DHA. Brain and vision development depend on these in the last trimester. Even mood disorders such as postpartum depression can be prevented with these fats found in fish oils. It\u2019s probably time to take a tour of your hospital\u2019s labor and delivery suite and ask about their policies for rooming-in (sharing a room with your baby) and immediate bonding.  Both have been shown to strengthen that mother-infant connection. If you are breastfeeding, it\u2019s time to roughen up the nipples \u2013 before baby gets ahold of them. Try daily rubbing and twisting but warned, that could start the milk flowing \u2013 so have breast pads available. Also note that active stimulation of the nipples in some cases can provoke contractions."}
