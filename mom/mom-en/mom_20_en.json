Weight gain for you is probably 8-10 pounds and the baby only 8-9 ounces, but the baby’s weight will start accelerating rapidly now – so good nutrition is a must. By now, you might be feeling a little winded when you walk or talk. It might be mild anemia or low iron. Good sources of iron include red meat, beans, pork, dried fruits, spinach, wheat germ and oatmeal. Your blood level will be measured again in 6-8 weeks when you get the diabetes test. You might start feeling tightening of the uterine wall that is painless. It’s really weird, especially when you put your hand over your uterus. It feels like the tip of your nose, not squishy like your cheek. It’s no cause for alarm so long as you don’t feel cramping or pain with them. They are called Braxton-Hicks contractions. They are not regular and tend to go away when you do something different like take a walk if you are resting. You will feel them on and off for the duration of pregnancy. They are the most common false alarms for real labor."
