And the hormones keep climbing, which means that everything and everyone is getting on your last nerve. Boob pain aside, your emotions are crazy now and it’s time to seriously think about a massage or a trip to solitary confinement at a spa. There’s nothing your partner can say or do except nod and clear the room. Hang in there, ‘the times they are a-changing’. Three more weeks and your boobs, mood, and attitude will improve as you get ready to enter the second trimester."
