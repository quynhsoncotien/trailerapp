Ultrasounds done early in pregnancy are the most reliable, but if you had one later-on, you might be off by 10-14 days, ugh!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, your body is done. By the time you're 41 weeks pregnant, your practitioner has probably discussed labor induction with you, but that doesn't mean that you won't still go into labor on your own; some babies just need to take their time. Your hormones and some from the baby are theorized to interact to start the labor process. It’s poorly understood, but oxytocin from the pituitary is released to begin the process. Oxytocin is the same thing as Pitocin – a drug used to start contractions and after birth, to stop the uterus from bleeding.\r\n\r\nAnother big job for your baby will be taking that first breath of air. The first breath requires considerable effort. That's why sucking out the fluid from the baby’s mouth and rubbing the chest right after childbirth helps that process. No spanking these days! That's because the tiny air sacs in the lungs are filled with amniotic fluid, and the amount of force to be inflated is quite a lot. That first cry is one of the most precious sounds a parent can hear. Because a crying baby is a breathing baby."
