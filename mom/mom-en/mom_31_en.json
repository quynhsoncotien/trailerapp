It starts early from the hormones, and then the physical limitations add to the problem in later pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThat breathlessness gets better once the baby drops into the pelvis and is no longer floating above the pubic bone. Don't forget to do daily kick counts.\r\n \r\nBuying or registering for a crib set? Skip the crib bumpers - they pose a serious SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) risk – as do pillows, stuffed animals, and blankets.\r\n\r\nIs your hospital bag packed? If not now’s an excellent time to get it ready, just in case."
