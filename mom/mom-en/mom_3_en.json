  "content": "This is the fateful week that determines whether you will become a new Mom. Slowly and deliberately, the blastocyst is propelled towards its new home where it will find a comfy spot to dig in for another 37 weeks or so. The implantation site is where this tiny, invisible blastocyst will keep multiplying so it can become an embryo. The embryo hooks up to mom’s uterine blood supply. Embryos are barely visible to the naked eye – about half the size of a Kiwi seed. The cells start to become different types, depending on the type of organ they will become. The early placenta starts to form; this will ultimately feed the embryo through the umbilical cord; once the umbilical cord is cut at birth, the stump becomes the baby’s belly button area. Sometimes a new Mom-to-be will experience bleeding during implantation. But, don’t be alarmed unless it is heavy. Once it stops, that should be the end of it for a very long time."
