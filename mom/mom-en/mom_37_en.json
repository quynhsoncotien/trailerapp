It’s now a good time to pack a baby bag and start the final preparations, such as stocking up your freezer and making double recipes for meals so that you won’t have to cook in the first couple of weeks after the baby comes. Finish up the baby room the best you can and while sitting and resting, consider perineal massage to stretch the perineum – the area between the vaginal opening and the rectum. It’s not clear if this really helps to prevent tearing or an episiotomy. And, it might be hard to do because of sheer body mechanics – but get some cocoa butter or another lubricant so that it is comfortable and pain-free. Your appetite may have decreased merely due to less room and comfort when eating. Heartburn and bloating are also big bummers now but keep drinking because water helps both conditions."
