Besides the extreme demands placed on every organ, the progesterone level is higher than ever, and progesterone makes you drowsy. Add that to low blood glucose because the baby gets fed first, and you start feeling like the walking dead.  The best you can do is eat more frequently, rest, nap, sleep, and repeat. Again, eat, drink, rest, nap, sleep - in that order. Try to avoid reliance on extra caffeine.  Just a few more weeks and you’ll feel tons better when you enter the second trimester – pure bliss in comparison to the one that precedes or follows it."
