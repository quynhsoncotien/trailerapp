Round ligaments are two ligaments, attached on each side of the uterus that extend down the side of the uterus to the beneath the pubic bone. As the uterus grows, these ligaments stretch with it. Sometimes you can feel a twinge in your vagina. These pains do not hurt you or the baby in any serious way; they’re just annoying and make you stop in your tracks and wince. Slow down, limit sudden twisting, don’t jump, and take a deep breath. It will go away with rest. \r\n\r\nGrab a bottle of water while you’re at it because you need more fluids in the second and third trimesters because your blood volume goes up by 50%. The heart pumps larger volumes faster. In fact, your entire blood volume goes through the entire utero-placental circulation in just 7 minutes! You’ll also notice more blue veins in your abdomen, breasts, arms, legs, and neck. The leg veins can become inflamed and bulging – called varicose veins and they can throb and hurt. Your feet and ankle start swelling, too. This will continue but can be managed with compression stockings and getting off your feet, lifting your legs above your hips so the blood can flow back to the heart faster."
