That could be good if you're like the nearly third or more pregnant women who develop varicose veins sometime during pregnancy. These swollen blood vessels can either develop or worsen when you’re expecting, though they rarely cause for concern. They come out because of the increased blood volume during pregnancy, because your growing uterus puts pressure on the pelvic veins and because of the relaxation of the veins due to hormones.\r\n\r\nHave you counted your baby’s kicks today? You should start these now. Once you've entered week 28, you should be counting them every day, once in the morning and once after dinner. Babies don't slow down with regard to the number of movements. The movements might not be as dramatic or forceful, but they do not stop. To do the counts, lay on your left side, see how long it takes to feel 10 movements. If it takes longer than an hour, call your health care provider.\r\n\r\nIt's time to stock up on breast pads now! Your breasts may leak colostrum – the nutritious pre-milk that will be your baby’s first food at birth."
