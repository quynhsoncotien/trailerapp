  "content": "Basketball belly time at 27 weeks of pregnancy; your uterus has swelled, expanded, and pushed away all the bowel that is now crowded up under the lungs. In fact, almost everything swells including the face. It's called edema. Severe facial edema is worrisome for a condition known as preeclampsia (or toxemia in the past) which is elevated blood pressure and protein in the urine. The cause is unknown, but it can be dangerous especially if it starts this early. Report any headaches or visual symptoms if you are also swelling a lot. To get puff relief, avoid sitting or standing for a long time, try some pregnancy-appropriate exercise like walking or swimming (if your practitioner okays it) and sit or sleep with your feet elevated. All of this excess water will be peed out a few days after you deliver. Do not restrict water intake as that will make matters worse and you could get dizzy from low blood pressure.\r\n\r\nYou know it’s wise to sign up for a birthing class. But it’s also smart to take an infant CPR class and even an infant care class, too. It’s time to buy a car seat as well; the hospital won’t let you leave with your newborn if you don’t have a car seat."
