  "content": "Week 40 has come and gone, just more of the same misery and anticipation – but now you are getting down-right sick of this. You will try anything to get this show on the road. Walk around the block, call your friends, write in your journal, shop online. Do anything to stop all the flurry of thoughts and worries. Stop worrying. The baby will come on its own or your practitioner will make it come before 42 weeks – in most cases. You will probably get an ultrasound and maybe even a ‘stripping’ of the membranes. What is that? The practitioner, with your permission, will do a cervical check and try to ream the cervix between the bag of water membrane and the fetal head, swooshing around the cervix to help stir up the pregnancy juices. Many times, this will work. If not, you will probably be scheduled for an ultrasound to check out the baby’s actual size and make sure the fluid level is normal; and you will probably have a non-stress test to check on the condition of the placenta."
